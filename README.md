# fairSIM
Free Analysis and Interactive Reconstruction for Structured Illumination Microscopy

This is the **development branch** for the integration of full 3D SR-SIM reconstruction
support into fairSIM. For release versions, please switch to the master branch.

Commits in this branch will likely be unstable, contain known 
errors and will often not compile. Also, the 3D code is currently not finished and
not working.

Also, the **Vector API** is likely to change in the next weeks and month!
